# Lab 5: Finite State Machine Design

## What We Did In The Last Lab

In our previous lab, we delved into the integration of microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators, expanding our understanding of digital circuitry. We explored components like the buzzer and ultrasonic sensor, mastering techniques to control them using Arduino microcontrollers. Through practical experiments, we learned to modulate sound intensity with the buzzer and accurately measure distances with the ultrasonic sensor. Finally, we applied this knowledge to a design challenge, creating a handheld distance detector. This lab emphasized the practical application of engineering principles in real-world scenarios.

## Overview and Motivation

This lab introduces the details of Finite State Machine (FSM) design, a fundamental concept in computer systems. The lab's primary objective is to construct a circuit capable of determining whether a binary number is divisible by three. This task involves simulating a sequential system that processes incoming binary digits one at a time and analyzes their collective value to ascertain divisibility. Through this exercise, we will gain valuable insights into FSMs, learning how to map out state transitions into state tables and implement combinational logic to drive the system's behavior. By engaging in this hands-on exploration, we will deepen our understanding of sequential circuits and enhance our problem-solving skills in digital design.

## Lab Objectives

1. Design a Finite State Machine (DFA - Deterministic Finite Automata) using a state transition diagram that checks if a binary string is divisible by 3.

2. Determine the number of JK Flip Flops needed for the amount of states our FSM has.

3. Design the logic for the two combinational circuits needed in our FSM design

4. Create a Boolean Truth Table diagram and use K-Maps for each output values to determine the boolean expressions needed for our combinational circuits. 

5. Build and Test the circuit in logisim

6. Build the circuit on the PB-503 breadboard
